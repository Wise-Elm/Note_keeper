###Program working title: 
Note Keeper

###Status:
This program is currently in production, and is primarily derived for the purpose of learning Python. Note Keeper is
intended to be a proof of concept. In its current form Note Keeper provides user interaction through a shell,
ex. (python application.py), and a more interactive experience with a persistent mode by using argument -p.

###Function:
This application is designed to aid in writing medical notes by allowing the user to construct, save, display, 
delete, and edit note templates. Note templates are intended to provide the basic structure of a patient note so that 
the practitioner can save time by filling the details rather than constructing a completely new note.

###Quick Look:
Note Taker provides functionality through the shell in 2 formats, use -h for more information. Integrated into the 
functionality is a Rotating Log Handler and application wide self testing.

###Programing Language:
Developed with Python 3.8.
